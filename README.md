### Leaked tokens

A token is a unique identifier that is used to authenticate and authorize users and applications. Tokens are often stored in cookies, local storage, or other browser storage mechanisms. If a token is leaked, it could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to user accounts or applications.

If you find a leaked prosper token, it is important to report it immediately to the Prosper Security team. You can usually do this by reaching out to [Prosper-security](mailto:security@prosper.com).

In addition to reporting the leaked token, you should also take steps to protect your own account and data. This may include changing your password, Look for suspicious emails or messages in your phone. Make sure the your device is free of malwares .

### Responding to a Leaked Token

If you are notified that your personal token has been leaked, you should take the following steps:

Revoke the token. This will prevent the attacker from using the token to gain access to your systems or data.
Generate a new token -> update in API if you are using API
Report the leaked token as explained below to security@prosper.com
